Design of the Haskell Packet Manager

Preamble:
Haskell Developers you have the most
disturbing Ecosystem and I will
never want to build a Project with
the "Tools" you can't call Project
Managers.
Because I can't use those "Tools",
I need to write one myself.

Goals:
1. It shouldn't be a general purpose
   Program, but rather something
   I can use.
2. I don't write into a Project File
   if I don't need to.
3. I need those Packages from Hackage, usw.



Usage:
hpm entry-file <root> 
               :  Builds entry-file in root Directory
                  
hpm init       :  Command to initialize Project File,
                  only necessary to build a Libary for Hackage.
hpm install <root>
               :  Install Libaries from Hackage, no hpm init necessary,
                  in root/.hpm/ Directory, in the Project you can import them
                  as in their Module Definiton.

hpm view <root>
              : shows information about root Directory ( Libaries installed, Project File )

HPM init:
The Init Command Files the Project.hs
File. It is writen in Haskell such that you
can import that File and use the Variables
Defined in it.
If you run hpm init it will ask you for these
informations about your project.
